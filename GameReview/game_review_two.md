## Summary

This game is about Kyle crane, a secret double agent who infiltrates a small band of survivors of the zombie outbreak. 
As Kyle Crane the player progresses throughout the campaign as an infected survival is caused by a zombie bite in the games prologue.
The point of the campaign is to get enough artisan (temporary cure for the infection) for Kyle and the survivors to hold off until
The world comes to rescue them. There are a few twists and turns along the way with some characters either nearly dying or actually dying.
The dialogue can be relatively funny sometimes, and other times it either falls flat or feels too acted out.

Where the game really shines is basically everywhere else. Being able to jump and leap building to building, run, jump, swim, glide, and
Grapple throughout the entirety of the map, with the exception of bordering mountains, feels fantastic. There are many ways to traverse
The sandbox, and even more ways to kill its inhabitants, them being zombies of course, and a few post outbreak gangs. You can find
Blueprints for crafting all sorts of conventional and unconventional weapons, from bats with nails, to the legendary sword Excalibur.
The day and night time cycles are great too, as I have often found myself nervously seeking shelter at night, because then the real scary
Come out at night. For those who decide not to cower and rest until daytime, the game rewards them with bonus experience points and
better rewards, incentives for those who brave the night.

There is also the ability to play cooperatively with up to four players, making the game that much more enjoyable. Every game is better
with a friend after all. The game also allows players to be invaded by their friends or random players. The invader takes the form of
what would be the apex zombie, that is tougher than any zombie available in the game, and is upgradable. The game has dozens of
Easter eggs, weapons, and quests for hours of fun. 

## Final Thoughts
What I did not like about the game was a few of the visual aspects of the game, it was at times difficult to look at this ridiculous 
Amount of film grain. The Story could have felt more weighted, I very frequently found myself forgetting that I was even infected.
However those are just visual gripes, and the story had more highlights than downsides. The entirety of the game is voice acted, and the mechanics
are great, I am very eager to see what Techland has in store for the next installment.
