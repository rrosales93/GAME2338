## Summary

  Darksiders is a post apocolyptic game based in a future where heaven and hell have collided on earth as their battleground.
Earth has become overrun by demons and other demonic or other wrodly creatures left over the war, and humanity is essentially extinct.
This sounds like the intro to a lot of different post apocolyptic games, however in Darksiders you're not some human trying to
take back the planet from demons. In Darksiders the player becomes War, one of the four-horsemen of the Apocolypse, sent to earth 
to discover the where abouts of the world ender, the one rumored to be responsible for starting the war that lead to earths destruction
and the breaker of the seaven seals. 

  The seaven seals are said to be mythical objects of Gods creation, these seals maintain the balance throughout the multiple realms
 in Darksiders. The kingdom of God where the angels reside, and where God has mysteriously gone missing, Earth, where the humans live,
and Hell, where the demons rule. The world was supposed to collapse in a very specific order, the seals where meant to be a contingency plan
to end all life and begin anew, However someone or something took it upon themselves to begin the apocolypse without breaking the seals
in order and jumping right to the bad part. 

  A mystical court of sentient entities known as the Council controls four very powerful assets enslaved from an ancient race to become 
 agents bound to bring balance, chaos, or justice by any means via a higher power. These four horsemen, should all seven seals be broken,
 were supposed to rain down with the might and power to rival both heaven and hell and complete their tasks, but only War arrivevd to earth
 1000 years too late. The council recalls War, deaming him the betrayer and the world ender, they had not authorized the horsemen to ride
 as the seventh seal that would sound the trumpets of their arrival was never broken. War must then redeem his name by bringing the one
 resonsible to justice by any means necessary.
## Final Thoughts
  Darkisders was a great game to play, with challenging enemies, creative bosses, and fun puzzles that made traversing the varius
 landscapes in the world of Darksiders a legitametly good experience. However Darksouls can definetly improve with a few mechanical changes
 that seemed to be easy oppurtunites. For example, cosmetically there were a few things that could have really gone a long way
 that appeared to be easily attainable but were just missed for some reason. deafeatting enemies to collect souls in order to upgrade
 is fantastic, but it would have been great to buy new armor, new colors for the robes, or even picking up fallen enemy weapons and 
 keeping them. Luckily the cosmetics and loot is fixed in the ladder installations of the game so I have to give them a props for fixing
 the later title Darksiders 2.
