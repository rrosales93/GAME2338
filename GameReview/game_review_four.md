### Rating

I rate this game an 85/100


## Summary

Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is the fourth installation into the the Assassin's Creed series. Black flag stands out from the 
rest of the series not only because it takes place in a separate time, but because it introduces a basket full of new
mechanics. As Edward Kenway we traverse the massive open ocean of the carribean and its many islands on a pirate ship 
commandeered by Edward and a customizable crew. Each Island is unique, full of beautiful jungles, palm trees, white sands, and 
of course hidden treasure. 

The game handles some heavy folliage and quite a few assets on screen without stuttering or choping too dramatically. 
The game can be very visually pleasing at times, however the graphics felt at times like it was undeserving of the next gen 
title. Loading screens could last anywhere between 4 and 10 minutes in my playing experience, and on ocassion there were 
some hysterical glitches where I would find my ship, crew, and other non-playable characters floating endlessly into the sky like 
a bad immitation of marry poppins. Graphics and glitches that I am sure have been patched by now aside, the game is still pretty
and works well to emmerse the player especially during ship battles.

Black Flag came at a perfect time, I had just watched Disney's pirattes of the carribean movie's and I wanted the thrill of 
being jack sparrow. Lo and behold Assassin's creed four came out and I found my solution to the outlaw itch I had been craving.
with any open world games there are certain mechanics and elements that have to be meet, if there is exploration involved then
there is need for navigation. If there is some form of customizable equipment whether it be strictly cosmetic or actually affects 
the players gameplay, then there needs to be a way of obtaining resources and a crafting mechanic built into the game. For every 
characteristic the game tries to cover there is a function that needs to be met. Assassin's creed IV understands that very well
with its Dynamic weather changes, resource managment, customization and a bunch of features that truly make the game emmersive.



## Final Thoughts

Over all Assassin's Creed IV: Black flag is a great sigh of relief from the previous titles, going in a different direction and the
addition of ship mechanics was by far the most impressive of the series, remaining even into its later installations. Its by far 
one of the most impressive games in the series for new comers into the series and those returning. Black Flag offers hours of
fun, exploration, and satisfying ship battles.
