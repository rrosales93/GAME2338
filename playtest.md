**Question:** During your playtesting were the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ While playing Monopoly Plus the rules were given to the player through readable cards on the menu just before the game is 
selected. There are varius rules to play by, however it appears that only one rule can be selected at a time even though it is never 
explicitly stated. 

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ During gameplay I did not notice anything that affected the game visually or mechanically. Honestly the game was rather
refreshing and the animations were sharp.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ The game being based on the random roll of the dice feels very balanced (unless of course when I had to declare bankruptcy)
. The target audience is obviously towards family's the game subtitles "Family Fun Pack" afterall.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ With Quarentine keeping everybody inside I believe those who have children would appreciate a chance to distract the whole family
with a familiar board game on the big screen, without any cheaters.I think the timing could not be more perfect for couch games and board games
like these.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ The games mechanics and theme did feel natural, bieng based on the board game counter part the game behaved and 
looked like the natural progression of the game moving digital.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ I enjoyed the game quite a bit, there is endless replayability, and it is very nostalgic. You can play with people from around
the world if you want to play but don't have anybody to play with.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ A big issue we encountered during gameplay were issues related to cooperative play. The game does not allow multiple players on
one console to play online with other players, and the game does not allow multiple rules to be applied. These limitations 
made it difficult to play with my friends who are quarentined without excluding other members of my house who really wanted to join the fun.
However mechanically teh game had no apparent glitches, I did have multiple problems on Uno though, Uno would have a major problem during multiplayer
often making it impossible for a random player to chose an interaction. We noticed it would appear to happen immediatly after a cconnection interruption.
If someone joined or left in the middle of the game, soon after one random person would be unable to chose an action and the game would ceaase 
indefinitley forcing the player to disconnect.
