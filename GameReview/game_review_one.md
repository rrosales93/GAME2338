crafting system that has me continuosly contemplating what gear pieces would work the best in tandem for each individual monster.

### Rating
I would give this game a 95/100.

## Summary
Monster Hunter World is one of the latest installments of the critically aclaimed Monster Hunter series. More importantly it is the first
installment of the series to be featured on both Xbox One and PS4 as well as PC. with this upgrade in hardware Capcom was able to
create a far more emmersive and detailed world of Monster Hunter than ever before. Players can create hundreds of different weapons from
Bows, to Lances, armor, and various other gear that will allow players to slay stronger and more unique monsters along their journey.

## Final Thoughts
I love the crafting system, farming for monsters feels rewarding and each monster never really loses value throught the entirety of the 
game. I find myself very frequently seeking SOS flares to help out players in need that happen to be fighting monsters I encountered at
the beginning of the DLC, because I need that monsters parts to help craft armor meant for creatures way later on in the title. The game
has constant events and updates, including holiday events with special armor and gestures to collect to show off online or to friends.
there are also monsters that have returned from previous titles, as well as brand new monsters, further increasing the library of armor 
and weaponry combinations. Thess resons and many other details are why I gave the game the rating I did, The only features I do not 
like about the game is that you can not trade, and that there is no form of cross-play, or cross-save.
