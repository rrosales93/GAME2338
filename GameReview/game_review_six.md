## Summary

  Fire Emblem: Heroes is a turn based strategy game available on mobile. The player is summoned into the world of Fire Emblem being
able to summon various characters from the franchise to fight alongside with. The world of Fire Emblem is engulfed in chaos, timelines
are out of order, and it is up to the player to summon heroes, save those timelines, and world of Fire Emblem.
  FE: Heroes has a very simple menu allowing a pleasent experience for the user to easily navigate through the application.
The game has a nice lobby displaying all the characters aqcuired by completing the main story line, special events, or usinhg the
summoning well. The game mehcanics bare a strong resemblence to chess, in that certain characters can move in specific ways, whether 
they can move adjacent, over certain terrain, and how many spaces they can move. Each characer can level up, learn new skills, abilites,
and technisques that help in completing missons as they get progressively more difficult. 
  The game is constantly updating, adding what if scenarios to the story that give an interesting twist to the franchise. Characters that 
 normally would not see each other in the main franchise, and the player gets to pick which charcters they would like to see fight one another.
 During special events, certain characters will appear in unique sprites, and clothing sucha as christmas attire, halloween, chinese new years,
 etc.. There is always a reason to go back and play, even if you only play the game extremly casually due to work, school, and social life.

## Final Thoughts

  What I did not enjoy about the game were the summoning well system, and the weak story. 
The summonig well did not feel rewarding, I always felt that no matter how many times I went back, I was never guaranteed at least one 
epic hero. Like I was just dumping countless hours grinding for the orbs required to use the summoning well, only to reaquire the same 
handfull of characters I had already summoned. It didn't help that the story made the grind last exponentially longer. If the game could
make the grind feel more replayable and rewarding, it would bump the game to a 80. The game lacked to grab my attention several times,
after a while I felt as if I could fall asleep.On a more positive note, the games mechanics are simple, with a simple weapon hierarchy hidden
by multiple layers ofcharacter quirks, make creating each party worthwhile. strategy is the game after all. The game has a pretty decent budget 
including pretty character sprites, art, and coice acting in multiple languages. overall the game is great for casual gaming, with it being a 
mobile game that makes sense. Fire Emblem: Heroes is a great game for anyone with a busy schedule.
